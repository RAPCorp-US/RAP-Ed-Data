This is an open source project that I just initiated with a sample display at https://rap-ed-data.web.app hosted on Google Firebase.
The goal of this project is to lookup, extract, analyze and publish reports on financial flows within Education.
The idea is to create full transparency concerning any public funds being allocated to education.
This tool should be user-friendly, easily accessible, and easy to publish reports from.
The nonprofit will also host important reports at rapcorp.us.
Please email help@rapcorp.us or the github account directly if you wish to contribute to this project.
